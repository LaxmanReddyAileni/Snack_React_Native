React Native Assessment

Assignment: Using json data from fruits.js create a list displaying cards of each fruit. Each card must contain the image and name of its fruit, and must expand to a larger size when pressed. On pressing an expanded card, the card should collapse back to its initial size. (See cards.png for what an expanded and default card should look like).

Feel free to use any libraries or methods; we just want to see how you problem-solve with React Native!
